Hello, the following should be made for the above to work.

1. Create a Localscript -> StarterCharacterScripts.
2. Add the client script code into it.
3. Create a ServerScript -> add it inside the Locascript -> Parent = Localscript.
4. Add the Server script code into it.
5. Add 2 Animations Parented to Localscript -> Named: Dash, Parry.
6. Add a RemoteEvent.
7. Thats all the combat system should work.
